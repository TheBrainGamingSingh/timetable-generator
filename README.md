# timetable-generator

This repository contains programs and scripts for timetable generation process. This could be used as template for timetable, university schedule generation. Because I don't like VBA, I will try to do something using my favorite language.


What script includes:
  - Skeleton generation with dates, gropus
  - adding classes with repeat option, grouping classes into groups

# To Do next

  - Adding new classes with predefined rooms, teachers,
  - UI - QT/WXWidget/GTK whatever
  - Serialization??
  - Printing timetable for each group
  - simplify API
